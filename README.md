# Contact Book Application

## Description
This is a simple desktop application developed in Java. It's a contact book where you can manage your contacts.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources. It contains the following sub-folders:
  - `src/main/java`: Contains the application source code.
  - `src/test/java`: Contains the test cases for the application.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies. Any JAR files in this directory or its subdirectories are referenced libraries.

## Packages
The application is divided into several packages:
- `com.contactbook.controller`: Contains the `ContactBookController` class which handles the application logic.
- `com.contactbook.model`: Contains the `ContactBookModel` class which handles the data in the contact book.
- `com.contactbook.view`: Contains the `ContactBookView` class which handles the user interface.
- `com.contactbook`: Contains the `Main` class which is the entry point of the application.
